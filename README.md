# Web-Based Weather App
It was created as part of SheCodes project, hosted on Netlify. For the demo, please visit - https://hungry-booth-48084d.netlify.app/.
## Description
This weather application is using real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API - https://openweathermap.org/. This application is not collecting or storing any data from the user, and it does not have any integrated tracking on cookies on the site. This application's primary function is to display weather data and forecast for the user's selected city.
## Functionality
In this application user can:
* Search for a city. Weather data is available for most cities; however, there might be cases where the data for smaller towns might not be available. In this case, the user will be presented with the feedback.
* Show when the weather data was last updated.
* Show the weather forecast with maximum temperature for the selected city in 3-hour time slots for the next 9 hours.
* User can select to display Fahrenheit or Celsius temperature.
* User can see the weather description, for example, "light rain", "showers" or similar.
* User can see wind speed and humidity data for their searched city.
## UX
The website was regularly tested on desktop.
